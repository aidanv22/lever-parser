# lever-parser
Developed a parser for a custom programming language supporting arithmetic, boolean expressions, variable assignments, control flow (if-else, while), and function calls. Focused on parsing techniques, abstract syntax trees (AST), scoping, type checking, and error detection (type mismatches, scope violations).
