# lexer-parser-part2
This project focuses on improving my understanding of scoping rules, type checking, and parser design. I implemented features to detect errors like type mismatches, scope violations, and variable redeclarations, with the parser generating helpful error messages. This builds on a basic parser I created in Project 1.

1. This is the updated grammar.
